What Might Be Missing or Worth Considering

1. Founder’s Hub / Executive Overview
	•	A “God Mode” view where founders see everything at a glance:
	•	Top 5 KPIs across departments
	•	Alerts from any module
	•	Revenue snapshot, active campaigns, ops status, risk indicators
	•	Could integrate the “Weekly Digest” here
	•	Add shortcut to “Automation Score” to nudge usage

2. Product / R&D Section
	•	For product-led businesses, this is huge:
	•	Feature Roadmap
	•	Feedback Loop System (integrated with Customer & Marketing)
	•	Idea Vault with voting from team/investors/partners
	•	Could even connect to “Launch Library”

3. Task & Team Collaboration
	•	You already have Project Management under Ops, but maybe:
	•	Add a Team Chat or Team Feed area for collaboration
	•	Simple task manager for non-project workflows
	•	Comment threads or @mentions inside SOPs or Campaigns

4. Inventory & Fulfillment
	•	If this is ecom-leaning at all:
	•	Inventory Tracking
	•	Fulfillment Status / Logistics Overview
	•	Could link to Print on Demand and Sales

5. Training & Onboarding Center
	•	You have Training Hub in HR — might need:
	•	Onboarding templates for new hires or VAs
	•	“Shadow Mode” or SOP-based training walkthroughs
	•	This helps users get their teams onboarded faster

6. Data Hub / Integrations
	•	One unified view of:
	•	Data sources (Google Analytics, Shopify, Stripe, CRMs)
	•	API management
	•	Native integrations status (Zapier, Slack, etc.)
	•	Helps founders know what’s connected

7. Security / Permissions Center
	•	Admin-level control over:
	•	Who sees what across departments
	•	Role-based permissions
	•	Login tracking, access logs

8. Culture / Mission Section (Optional but cool)
	•	For modern startups:
	•	Display Mission, Vision, Core Values
	•	Recognition / “Wins of the Week”
	•	Team directory with birthdays, roles, start dates
	•	Culture tracker or poll widget
