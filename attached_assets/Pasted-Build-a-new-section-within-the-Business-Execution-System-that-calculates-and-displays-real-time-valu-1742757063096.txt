Build a new section within the Business Execution System that calculates and displays real-time valuations for each business entity in the system. This can either live inside the Partner & Investor Portal or be a standalone module called “Valuation.” The purpose is to give founders, owners, and investors a clear and motivating sense of what each business is worth at any time — both at the entity level and across the full enterprise.

Include the following features:
	1.	Enterprise Value Overview (Top Level)
– Display the estimated valuation of the full group of companies combined
– Break down by entity: DMP, Mystery Hype, AlcoEaze, Lone Star, Hide Cafe Bars
– Show total revenue across all brands, total estimated value, and YOY growth
– Visual dashboard with line graphs for valuation trends over time
	2.	Individual Business Valuation Dashboards
– Each business gets its own card or page with its estimated valuation
– Include real-time or manually entered revenue (monthly, trailing 12 months, annual)
– Owner inputs or selects an estimated sales multiple (or use industry average)
– Auto-calculate: Valuation = Revenue x Sales Multiple
– Display the calculated number clearly with growth % change (week, month, quarter)
	3.	Sales Multiple Input Options
– Allow users to select or input a custom multiple based on business model (e.g., DTC brand, SaaS, hospitality)
– Option to use system-provided industry average multiples (reference: SaaS = 5-8x, eComm = 2-4x, Bars = 0.8-2x)
– Tooltip explaining what sales multiples are and why they matter
	4.	Equity Holder View (Optional)
– For each partner, show estimated value of their equity stake
– Pull from Cap Table data: (Ownership %) x (Business Valuation)
– Display “Your Stake Value” for motivational use
	5.	Motivational Visuals
– Show growth trajectory and how changes in revenue or multiple impact total value
– Add “What If” slider: adjust revenue or multiple to visualize potential future value
– Include AI suggestions: “Increase retention by 10% to boost valuation by $X”
	6.	Admin Control Panel
– Allow admin users to approve or override default revenue inputs and multiples
– Set visibility (private, owner-only, partner-visible)
	7.	Optional Integrations
– Pull revenue data from Shopify, Stripe, QuickBooks, etc.
– Pull industry multiples via API or static reference table
	8.	PDF/Export Feature
– Add ability to generate and export a one-pager valuation report for each business
– Include summary of revenue, multiple used, valuation breakdown, and growth chart

Design the valuation area to be clean, exciting, and enterprise-grade. Use bold fonts for valuation numbers, color-coded growth indicators (green/red), and mobile responsiveness. This section should give business owners and partners constant visibility into their company’s worth, empowering smarter decisions, better investor comms, and long-term planning.
