Please finalize each main section of the DMPHQ SaaS app by building full feature sets inside the existing routed pages, without changing the current side menu structure. Every module should be fully interactive, visually complete, and demo-ready. Additionally, all homepage cards should be clickable and route to their correct pages. Use tabs or cards inside pages instead of creating new routes. Here are the numbered tasks:
	1.	Make every homepage card clickable and ensure it routes to the correct page (e.g., Automation Score should link to the Operations Dashboard, Company Health should link to Strategy Dashboard).
	2.	In the Marketing page, build three sections: (a) Email Campaigns — include a campaign builder with subject, body, and segment selector, plus a log of 3–5 past campaigns with open rate, click rate, and status tags; (b) Ad Performance — add cards for TikTok, Meta, and Google Ads with mock Spend, ROAS, CTR, and a trendline chart; (c) SEO Tracker — include a table of keywords with rank, volume, and change %, and add 5–10 demo keywords.
	3.	In the Sales page, create three functional areas: (a) Funnel View — build a visual funnel or Kanban board with lead stages (New, Contacted, Demo, Closed) that can be updated; (b) Inbound Sales — add a list of recent orders (Shopify, Stripe, etc.) with source, value, and customer name; (c) Outbound Tracker — create a table for cold outreach with columns for contact, last touch, status, and next action, plus a response rate summary.
	4.	In the Operations page, add a SOP Library with 3 demo SOPs showing title, owner, and last updated; include a “Create SOP” button; display the Automation Score with a progress bar and 2–3 AI-powered suggestions for improvement.
	5.	In the Customer CRM page, build a CRM table with customer name, contact info, segment tags, and LTV; include customer segments (VIP, New, At Risk); and add a card for NPS score with recent feedback entries.
	6.	In the Finance page, finalize the Valuation module with editable revenue and multiplier; add a forecast chart using 12 months of mock data; build a basic P&L summary table; and include an “Export PDF” button.
	7.	In the Partner Portal, create a file upload section for pitch decks and reports; add a cap table visual and editable data table; include a “Send Digest” or “Export Summary” button; and show a Stakeholder Equity card with mock ownership value.
	8.	In the Strategy page, create a Company Health Scorecard with 3–5 contributing metrics; build a North Star Metrics list; include a quarterly Goal Tracker with the ability to set milestones; and add an “Add Goal” button.
	9.	In the Legal page, build a compliance checklist UI for LLC, EIN, trademarks, and contracts; allow document uploads; and show a legal completion progress bar.
	10.	Ensure all modules use clean card layouts, hover effects, and consistent styling. Use Tailwind or your existing design system.
	11.	Add floating action buttons or call-to-actions inside relevant pages (e.g., “+ New Campaign,” “+ Add SOP”).
	12.	Include mock data in every section where real data isn’t yet connected. Make sure all content is scrollable, clickable, and styled to match your existing homepage and sidebar.

Once complete, every dashboard should feel complete, enterprise-ready, and functionally aligned with top-tier SaaS platforms. This will prepare DMPHQ for internal scale, investor demos, and external licensing.
