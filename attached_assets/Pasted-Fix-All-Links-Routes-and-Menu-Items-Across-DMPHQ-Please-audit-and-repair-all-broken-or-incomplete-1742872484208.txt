Fix All Links, Routes, and Menu Items Across DMPHQ

Please audit and repair all broken or incomplete links, routes, and page loads across the DMPHQ app. The goal is to ensure a seamless, launch-ready experience across the sidebar, top nav, homepage, and footer. All links must route to actual working pages, even if using placeholder content.
	1.	Fix Sidebar Navigation

	•	Audit each sidebar item (including sub-items like “Operations” and “Operations Dashboard”)
	•	Remove or replace broken links that cause errors or do not load
	•	Ensure every item routes to a working page using the appropriate React router logic
	•	If necessary, rebuild the “Operations Dashboard” from scratch and route /operations-dashboard correctly

	2.	Fix Header Links

	•	Ensure all header dropdown items route to the correct pages
	•	Add placeholder components/pages where missing
	•	Test on mobile and desktop views

	3.	Fix Footer Links

	•	About Us → /about
	•	Partners → /partners
	•	Help / Support → /help
	•	Privacy Policy → /privacy
	•	Terms → /terms
	•	Add any missing placeholder pages with a basic heading and text like “This page is under construction”

	4.	Create or Rebuild Broken Pages

	•	For any routes like /operations-dashboard that never worked, rebuild the page using a clean layout and placeholder data if needed
	•	Use TailwindCSS for consistent layout and spacing
	•	Ensure demo mode is supported (use mock cards, stats, etc.)

	5.	Verify All Links

	•	Test every link on:
	•	Sidebar
	•	Header nav
	•	Footer
	•	Homepage cards
	•	All buttons should lead to working routes with no visual or logic errors
	•	Add 404 handling or fallback pages for bad routes (optional)

	6.	Final Touches

	•	Add loading states if routes take more than a second
	•	Add hover and active states for all menu items and links
	•	Ensure full mobile responsiveness

Once complete, the app should behave like a polished, enterprise-grade SaaS product where every user interaction results in a real page or module, not an error or blank space.
