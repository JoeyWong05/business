Prompt: Upgrade My Business Execution System to a World-Class SaaS Product

Please upgrade and optimize my Business Execution System app into a modern, enterprise-ready SaaS platform. Maintain all current modules: Finance, Operations, Marketing & Sales, and Customer — but enhance them visually, structurally, and functionally. Implement the following:

⸻

1. UI/UX Overhaul (Based on Top SaaS Tools)
	•	Redesign homepage into a modular dashboard layout with 4–6 core tiles (e.g., “Finance Overview,” “Current Automation Score,” “Open Tasks,” etc.)
	•	Add a sticky sidebar with icons and section labels (grouped into categories like Core, Advanced, Partner Tools)
	•	Implement a top navigation bar with:
	•	Profile dropdown (Settings, Logout, Theme)
	•	Dark mode toggle
	•	“Last updated” timestamp
	•	Notifications or alerts icon
	•	Create clean section headers with cards or tabs inside each module (e.g., Finance > Valuation, P&L, Forecast)
	•	Use TailwindCSS (or another design system) for consistent spacing, padding, shadows, and typography
	•	Add basic page transitions and number animation for metrics (e.g., revenue growth counters)

⸻

2. Build Missing or Incomplete Modules

A. Valuation Module
	•	Input: Revenue + Sales Multiple
	•	Output: Valuation, Ownership %, Stake Value
	•	Add “What If” sliders and export button

B. SEO & Visibility
	•	Input keywords you want to rank for
	•	Show on-page vs off-page performance (meta tags, speed, backlinks, etc.)
	•	Add competitor keyword tracker and suggestion engine

C. Investor / Partner Portal
	•	Upload: Cap tables, pitch decks, investor updates
	•	Add value summary cards, PDF export, and restricted access per user

D. Strategy & North Star Metrics
	•	Add a “Company Health” dashboard showing:
	•	Automation score
	•	Fulfillment stats
	•	Lead gen numbers
	•	Financial trendlines
	•	Custom metrics input

E. Omni-Channel Sales Manager
	•	Add cards for Shopify, TikTok Shop, Amazon, etc.
	•	Let user input or connect data
	•	Show real-time orders, revenue, and inventory sync

⸻

3. Functionality Improvements
	•	Implement lazy loading for large modules like Partner Portal, CRM, Omni-Sales
	•	Optimize performance by removing unused components and redundant console logs
	•	Add role-based dashboards (Owner, Operator, Partner, Viewer)
	•	Show tailored data depending on user level (Investor sees cap table; Ops sees fulfillment, etc.)
	•	Make system mobile responsive and fully navigable on iPad/laptop/desktop

⸻

4. Make It SaaS-Ready
	•	White-label capability: allow business name, logo, and color scheme customization
	•	Add multi-company switching (dropdown for users managing multiple entities)
	•	Include a pricing strategy modal or backend config so we can offer this as:
	•	SaaS ($49–$199/mo per user)
	•	Enterprise licensing ($10k–$50k annually)
	•	Consulting add-on ($5k–$50k implementation packages)

⸻

Bonus: Future AI Add-Ons (Optional)
	•	AI suggestions on automation
	•	Smart SOP generator based on task history
	•	Predictive forecasting from past trends
