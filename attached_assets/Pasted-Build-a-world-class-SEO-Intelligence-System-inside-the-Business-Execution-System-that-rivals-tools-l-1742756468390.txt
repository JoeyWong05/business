Ensure this module is fully visual with graphs, tables, filters, and search. Use a left-hand nav for major sections and support mobile responsiveness. Allow users to connect their own Google Search Console and Analytics accounts. Give each business its own SEO dashboard with data segmented by domain or page. This SEO system should be intelligent, actionable, and powerful enough to replace external tools like Ahrefs, Moz, and SEMrush — directly integrated into our internal platform.
