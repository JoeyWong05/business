Finalize and Fully Build All Existing Tools in DMPHQ (With Direct Tool Comparisons)

The app layout, pages, and navigation are already complete. Do not create any new routes or redesign the structure. Your task is to go into each existing tool/module and fully activate it so it works as a real business system — matching or exceeding the features of the SaaS tools it replaces.

Each tool should use TailwindCSS, support demo mode, and be mobile responsive. Every feature must be interactive and functional — no placeholders, broken buttons, or empty views.
