world-class, scalable, mobile-friendly platform used to manage multiple companies (DMP, Mystery Hype, AlcoEaze, Lone Star Custom Clothing, Hide Cafe Bars), with potential to offer it as a SaaS product. Start by improving the UI/UX: Add a fixed sidebar for module navigation including Dashboard, CRM, Finance, Outreach, SEO, Legal, Omni-Sales, Automation, and Tools. Improve visual hierarchy with larger headers, clear section dividers, and better spacing. Assign each company its own logo and color-coded section. Add tooltips for the Automation Score explaining how it’s calculated and how to improve it, with 3–5 AI suggestions underneath. Add “Coming Soon” cards for unfinished sections like SEO, Legal, and Omni-Sales. Add a loading spinner or smooth transition effect when loading modules. Build the SEO Management module with keyword tracking, site audit checklist, and Google Search Console integration. Build the Legal & Compliance section with NDA and contract templates, a business formation checklist (LLC, EIN, Trademark), and the ability to upload legal documents. Build an Omni-Channel Sales dashboard that connects Shopify, Amazon, TikTok Shop, and more, displaying inventory, sales, and sync alerts. Add customizable reporting and analytics dashboards with charts and filters for time ranges, company, and key metrics like outreach and sales. Embed an AI assistant that evaluates each company’s automation level and gives improvement tips. Add a Generate Weekly Digest button that pulls data from across the system and exports as PDF or emails it. Show a footer with the deployment version like “Build: [Date] — v0.X”. Build a drag-and-drop workflow builder like Zapier that lets users automate tasks (e.g., “If sale made → update CRM → send Slack alert”) with prebuilt workflows for ecommerce and hospitality. Add a unified inbox to merge email, Instagram DMs, TikTok messages, and SMS using the Twilio API, with AI thread summarization. Add a Company Health Snapshot page showing Sales, Outreach, Inventory, SEO, Automation Score, and Support tickets, with filtering by business and export option. Implement team roles and permissions, allowing admins to assign access by department and include an audit log of activity. Create a Smart SOP Generator that uses AI to turn user-recorded steps or typed workflows into structured SOPs that can be saved, shared, or duplicated across businesses. After these features are complete, also begin development on modules for Inventory & Fulfillment Tracking by SKU and business, a Content Calendar for social media planning with AI ideas, a KPI Tracker for CAC, ROAS, and fulfillment time, a Partner/Investor Portal for internal sharing, and a mobile-optimized web version (PWA). Make sure the system is clean, responsive, scalable, white-label ready, and powered by AI wherever appropriate.
