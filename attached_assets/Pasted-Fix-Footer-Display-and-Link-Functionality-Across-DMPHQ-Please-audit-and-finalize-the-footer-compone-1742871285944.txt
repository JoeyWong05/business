Fix Footer Display and Link Functionality Across DMPHQ

Please audit and finalize the footer component across the entire DMPHQ platform to ensure visual consistency, proper routing, and full functionality on every screen size and page. The goal is for the footer to feel fully polished and complete ahead of launch.
	1.	Fix Footer Display Bug

	•	The footer should never appear as a large white block or interfere with page layout
	•	Ensure it stays anchored to the bottom of the page (sticky or static depending on content height)
	•	Match footer styling to the rest of the app (dark mode compatible, correct padding, consistent font)

	2.	Link All Footer Pages Correctly
Make sure the following footer links route to actual pages — either ones already created or new pages to be built. Create and route to the following if they don’t exist yet:

	•	About Us → /about
	•	Our Story → /story
	•	Partners → /partners
	•	Features → /features
	•	Pricing → /pricing
	•	Roadmap → /roadmap
	•	Product Updates → /updates
	•	Help Center → /help
	•	Tutorials → /tutorials
	•	Contact Support → /contact
	•	Privacy Policy → /privacy
	•	Terms of Use → /terms
	•	Security & Compliance → /security

	3.	Create Placeholder Pages (If Needed)

	•	Each of these pages can have a basic header + paragraph layout initially
	•	Add placeholder content like “Coming Soon” or “This page will contain information about [X]”
	•	Ensure the page loads properly and the route matches the footer link

	4.	Design Requirements

	•	Footer should be styled using TailwindCSS to match the app’s layout
	•	Font sizes, spacing, and hover effects must be consistent
	•	Add hover styling to each link
	•	Make footer responsive and mobile-friendly (stack columns or collapse into a dropdown on small screens)

	5.	Test Across Pages

	•	Make sure the footer appears and behaves consistently on all major pages: Homepage, Operations, CRM, Marketing, Sales, Projects, Partner Portal, Strategy, etc.
	•	Ensure no visual glitches, spacing bugs, or broken layout conflicts

Once complete, the footer should look and feel production-ready across all breakpoints and routes, with all links leading to working or placeholder pages.
