Finalize and Populate All Pages to Launch DMPHQ as a World-Class SaaS Platform

Please complete and polish the Business Execution System (DMPHQ) so that every section in the sidebar routes to a fully functional, visually polished, and demo-ready page. The goal is to make this a world-class, viral-ready SaaS product for internal and external use, with no empty or weak modules.

⸻

Core Goals:
	•	Every sidebar link must lead to a fully populated page
	•	Each page must be interactive, professional, and styled like a modern SaaS tool
	•	Include realistic demo data for all key modules
	•	Ensure the system feels “ready to run a business” — or sell to founders
