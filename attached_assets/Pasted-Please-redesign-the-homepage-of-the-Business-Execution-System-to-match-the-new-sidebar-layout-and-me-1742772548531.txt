Please redesign the homepage of the Business Execution System to match the new sidebar layout and meet modern enterprise SaaS standards. This should be a clean, modular dashboard using the FOMSC structure (Finance, Operations, Marketing, Sales, Customer), with a premium visual design. The homepage should serve as a business command center for founders, partners, and executives. This layout must be mobile responsive, scalable, and aligned with the design language of platforms like Stripe, Notion, and Salesforce.

	•	Use TailwindCSS or modern UI system for layout, shadows, spacing, animations

	•	Do not remove existing data — just restructure it
