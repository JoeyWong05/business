Please build a new module inside DMPHQ called “Projects” or “Task Manager” that allows users to create, manage, and track tasks and projects. This should fully replace tools like Asana, Trello, and Basecamp. It must include an AI Assistant for generating tasks, and it should be fully responsive for mobile, styled using TailwindCSS, and integrated into the existing DMPHQ layout.
