Build a world-class Business Valuation module inside the Business Execution System. This section should calculate and visually display the estimated value of each business in real time. It should be motivational for business owners and partners, and impressive enough for investor use. Make it modular so it can be used for multiple businesses and investor dashboards.

Include the following features:
	1.	Inputs (Editable by Admin or Owner)
– Annual Revenue (manually entered or connected via Shopify/Stripe/QuickBooks)
– Sales Multiple (dropdown with presets by industry or custom input)
– Ownership % (optional, to show stake value for logged-in user)
	2.	Outputs (Calculated Automatically)
– Estimated Valuation = Revenue × Sales Multiple
– Stake Value = Estimated Valuation × Ownership %
– Valuation Growth % (vs last saved period)
– Charts: valuation trend line + “What If” projections
	3.	UI Layout
– Display all values in a clean card-style layout
– Dropdown selector at the top for switching between businesses
– Display bold, animated numbers for motivation
– Include a mini “What If” tool that lets users adjust revenue or multiple and see projected valuation changes in real-time
– Add an industry multiple reference table (e.g., DTC Apparel = 2.5–4x, SaaS = 5–8x, Bars = 0.8–2x)
	4.	AI Enhancements (Optional)
– Display smart suggestions like:

	•	“Increasing revenue by 15% would increase valuation by $X”
	•	“Optimizing retention could increase your multiple to 4.0x”
– Add a tooltip or help icon explaining what a valuation multiple is and why it matters

	5.	Export Feature
– Add a “Generate Report” button to download a 1-page valuation summary (PDF or CSV)
– Include business name, revenue, multiple, valuation, ownership %, stake value, and visual chart
	6.	Design Guidelines
– Use TailwindCSS or modern design system
– Mobile-friendly, clean layout with charts and sliders
– Show growth color indicators (green for up, red for down)
– Add animations when numbers change for user engagement

This module should live under its own section called “Valuation” or inside the Partner/Investor Portal. It must support multiple businesses and multiple users, and feel high-end and accurate enough to present to investors, founders, and stakeholders.
