Please create a new section in the DMPHQ platform called “Agency Killer.” This should be a centralized, AI-powered suite of tools that helps business owners eliminate the need to hire SEO agencies, ad agencies, copywriters, and strategy consultants. It should be designed like a modular dashboard, using tabs or cards within a single page, and styled consistently with the rest of DMPHQ.

Build the following features inside the page:
	1.	AI Copy Generator
	•	Add a text input for product, goal, or offer
	•	Let users select tone (e.g., Bold, Friendly, Professional, Luxury)
	•	On button click, generate:
	•	Email subject lines and bodies
	•	Landing page copy
	•	Social media ad copy (headline + body)
	•	Instagram caption ideas
	•	Include “Copy to Clipboard” button under each output
	2.	SEO Toolkit
	•	Add URL input to simulate a site audit
	•	Display output cards with suggested:
	•	Title tags

	•	Generate a full funnel map:
	•	Step 1: Landing Page
	•	Step 2: Email Follow-up Sequence
	•	Step 3: Retargeting Ads
	•	Step 4: Close + Upsell
	•	Include a visual card layout or progress builder
	5.	Performance Simulator (Optional Bonus)
	•	Based on inputs (budget, CTR, ROAS), simulate what kind of results the campaign could yield
	•	Include adjustable sliders for budget or conversion rates
	6.	General Design Notes
	•	Use tabs or card layout to separate each tool
	•	Make the section fully responsive and consistent with DMPHQ design
	•	Use Tailwind styling with clean headings, spacing, and interactive elements
	•	Label this section clearly as “Agency Killer” in the sidebar
