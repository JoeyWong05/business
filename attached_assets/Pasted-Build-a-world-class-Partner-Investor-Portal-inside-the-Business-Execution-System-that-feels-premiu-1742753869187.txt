Build a world-class Partner & Investor Portal inside the Business Execution System that feels premium, secure, and investor-ready. This portal should only be accessible to users with the “Partner” or “Investor” role and must be fully branded to match the specific business. Include support for multi-company switching — allow users with access to multiple businesses (e.g., DMP, Mystery Hype, Lone Star, AlcoEaze, Hide Cafe Bars) to toggle between brands from a dropdown at the top of the portal. When switching, all data, assets, reports, and metrics shown should update according to the selected business.

Display a welcome message and clear label showing which business the user is currently viewing. Include a clean dashboard with summarized high-level metrics such as Total Sales, Growth %, Automation Score, Fulfillment Speed, Outreach Stats, and Revenue Split. Allow filtering by date range and show clean visual graphs for trends. Add a Monthly Reports section where admins can upload PDF or video updates. Automatically organize reports by month with inline preview and download functionality. Include notes with each report and optional comments from partners or investors.

Add a Cap Table & Equity Breakdown section where admins can upload cap table PDFs or manually input ownership data. Display a visual pie chart showing stakeholder breakdown, and clearly show each partner’s individual % ownership. Include a lightweight Announcements or News Board for updates like new launches, milestones, product releases, or hiring. Enable emoji reactions or “mark as read” tracking.

Add an Export Digest button that generates a printable or shareable PDF with all key metrics, recent reports, and announcements, with an option to automatically email it to all active partners or investors.

Include an Assets & Docs section with organized folders or tags for: Pitch Decks, Fundraising Docs, Roadmaps & Vision Decks, Legal Agreements, and Brand Materials. Allow upload and inline preview of PDFs, PPTX, DOCX, PNG, and MP4. Allow tagging and sorting by upload date and version. Include brand guidelines with logo downloads, color usage rules, and media kits. Ensure visibility settings for each document or folder can be adjusted (admin-only, investor-only, partner-only, or public).

Design the full portal with a modern, clean card layout. Use branding elements like the business logo, primary colors, and a favicon. Include user profile access, settings, and logout in the top-right corner. Add notification indicators for new content. Include a dark mode toggle and ensure full mobile responsiveness. Optional: add a comment thread or messaging box where partners can leave feedback or ask follow-up questions directly on any report or section.

This Partner Portal should feel like a premium investor experience — something any founder, VC, or investor would feel confident sharing with others, using regularly, or relying on for strategic insights. It should be secure, fast, easy to navigate, and capable of scaling to hundreds of companies or partners.
