Fix All Non-Functional Buttons, Cards, and Routes Across DMPHQ

Please audit and fix all broken or non-functional buttons, links, and cards throughout the DMPHQ platform. The goal is to ensure that every interactive element across the sidebar, homepage, and module pages performs its intended action — including routing, modals, form submissions, or toggles. This is required to complete the final polish before public or beta launch.
	1.	Sidebar Navigation

	•	Ensure every item in the sidebar routes correctly to its respective dashboard or module
	•	Test routes like: /finance-dashboard, /operations-dashboard, /crm-dashboard, /agency-killer, /projects-dashboard, etc.
	•	Fix any buttons or sections that show no response or route incorrectly

	2.	Homepage Cards & Buttons

	•	Make all homepage tiles/cards clickable and route to the correct module
	•	Example: “Automation Score” card → /operations-dashboard
	•	“Company Health” → /strategy-dashboard
	•	“Campaigns” → /marketing-dashboard
	•	Test all CTA buttons such as “View Details,” “Go to Module,” and fix any that do not respond

	3.	In-Module Buttons

	•	Test and fix functionality for all in-module CTAs, including:
	•	“Create Task”
	•	“Add Campaign”
	•	“Create SOP”
	•	“Apply Template”
	•	“Export PDF”
	•	“Save” and “Submit” buttons
	•	Ensure that clicking these buttons performs the intended action (e.g. updates data, opens modal, submits form)

	4.	Demo Mode Compatibility

	•	All routes and buttons should function in demo mode — they must display mock data or pre-filled interactions
	•	Disable write actions if needed, but always show a working UI response or visual feedback

	5.	General Requirements

	•	Use router logic consistent with the current app structure (e.g., React Router if applicable)
	•	Show success/failure messages on form submits or interactive actions
	•	Include hover, active, or loading states on key buttons
	•	Fix any unresponsive clickable areas (especially inside cards or tiles)

Once complete, all core UI elements should be fully functional and provide a seamless, interactive experience across the entire app.
